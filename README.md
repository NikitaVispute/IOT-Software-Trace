# IOT-Software-Trace

Technology used: Android (APP), Embedded C (Arduino), GPS/GSM Module, RFID tags, C# (Visual Studio Web Server).

<ul>
<li>Designed an automated system that tracks and displays the studentâ€™s location (GPS and RFID tag) on their entry/exit into/from the school as well as their location on the bus when in transit.</li><br>
<li>It also keeps track of the location and time of entry/exit updated in real-time and storing it on the web server.</li><br>
<li>Displays real time location on the APP. </li><br>
<li>It also sends alerts to parents through SMS.</li></ul>

The software has 3 parts:<br>
1. The hardware (GSM-GPS Module, Arduino circuit board, RFID tag and reader, WIFI module)<br>
2. Web Server (Consisting of Admin and Parent user pages, database consisting of location, time and other student details)<br>
3. Android App (Authentication, Location in real-time maps)
